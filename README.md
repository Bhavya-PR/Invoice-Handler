# Yavar.AI Hackathon Invoice Handler
 
# Invoice Extraction & Verification System
## ðŸš€ Overview
An Automated Invoice Processing System utilizes **OCR (Tesseract)** and **YOLOv8** to extract, validate, and process invoice data efficiently. It converts PDFs into structured **JSON and Excel reports**, ensuring accurate financial document handling while detecting seals/signatures for verification. Additionally, **Groq's Llama3 model** enhances text parsing, intelligently correcting and inferring missing invoice details.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python** â†’ Main programming language for processing

- **Tesseract OCR** â†’ Optical character recognition for text extraction

- **PDF2Image** â†’ Converts PDFs into images for better OCR accuracy

- **OpenCV** â†’ Preprocesses images (grayscale, sharpening, noise removal)

- **YOLOv8** â†’ Deep learning model for seal/signature detection

- **Pandas** â†’ Handles structured data, converts JSON to Excel output

- **LangChain & Groq's Llama3** â†’ LLM-based intelligent text parsing & correction

- **dotenv** â†’ Manages environment variables for API security

- **JSON** â†’ Stores extracted invoice data in a structured format

- **Regex** â†’ Cleans and refines OCR-extracted text

- **Subprocess** â†’ Executes pipeline components dynamically

- **cv2 (OpenCV)** â†’ Image transformations & noise reduction

- **NumPy** â†’ Efficient array handling for image and text processing
