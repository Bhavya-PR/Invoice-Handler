# Yavar.AI Hackathon – Invoice Extraction & Verification System

An AI-Powered Invoice Processing System designed for automated, accurate, and scalable financial document handling. It uses **OCR**, **Computer Vision**, and **LLM-based parsing** to extract, validate, and structure invoice data from scanned PDFs into **JSON** and **Excel reports**, with intelligent verification using **seal/signature detection** and **missing detail inference**.

## Overview

This system performs the following:
- Converts **PDFs to images**
- Applies **preprocessing** to enhance OCR clarity
- Extracts **invoice text** using **Tesseract OCR**
- Detects **seals and signatures** using **YOLOv8**
- Parses text into **structured JSON** using **Groq's Llama3**
- Validates & assigns **confidence scores**
- Outputs **Excel reports** using **Pandas**

## Preprocessing Steps for OCR Optimization

-  **Grayscale conversion** to eliminate background noise
-  **Adaptive thresholding** to improve text contrast
-  **Denoising** using Gaussian & Non-Local Means (NLM)
-  **Morphological operations** to clean broken characters
-  **Regex formatting** for standardizing invoice content

---

## LLM Parsing & Optimization

-  Engineered prompts to guide **Groq’s Llama3** for clean structured output
-  Confidence scoring to evaluate data reliability
-  Refined invoice field extraction using pattern rules
-  Corrects missing or unclear data intelligently

##  Fine-Tuning Summary

| Component         | Optimization Done                                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Tesseract OCR**| Used `--psm 6 --oem 3` for layout-aware accuracy     |
| **YOLOv8**       | Adjusted IoU & confidence thresholds for seals      |
| **Llama3**       | Prompt engineering for precise JSON formatting      |

##  Project Workflow – Step-by-Step

### 1️. PDF-to-Image Conversion (`preprocess.py`)
✔ Converts PDF invoices to images using **Poppler**  
✔ Prepares images for better OCR accuracy (resolution enhancement, format conversion)

### 2️. Image Preprocessing for OCR (`preprocess.py`)
✔ Grayscale conversion to remove noise  
✔ Adaptive thresholding to enhance contrast  
✔ Denoising & sharpening for clearer text extraction

### 3️. Extract Text Using OCR (`ocr_utils.py`)
✔ Runs **Tesseract OCR** to extract text from processed images  
✔ Cleans extracted text for better alignment & formatting

### 4️. Detect Seals & Signatures (`image_utils.py`)
✔ Uses **YOLOv8** to identify official seals/signatures  
✔ Saves detection results in `output/seal_signatures/`

### 5️. AI-Powered Text Parsing (`parser.py`)
✔ Uses **Groq's Llama3 (LLM)** to structure messy OCR output into JSON format  
✔ Ensures proper extraction of fields like:
- Invoice number
- Date
- GST details
- Item descriptions, etc.,

### 6️. Confidence Scoring & Validation (`validator.py`)
✔ Assigns a confidence score to extracted invoice fields  
✔ Flags missing or uncertain data for further review  
✔ Generates `output/extracted_data.json` containing validated invoice details

### 7️. Generate Excel Report (`convert_to_excel.py`)
✔ Converts extracted JSON invoice data into structured Excel format  
✔ Saves reports to `output/extracted_data.xlsx`

### 8️. Final Output & Storage
✔ All processed data stored in:
- `output/extracted_text/` → OCR-extracted text  
- `output/parsed_json/` → Structured JSON  
- `output/extracted_data.json` → Aggregated invoice details  
- `output/extracted_data.xlsx` → Final structured report  
- `output/verifiability_report.json` → Confidence scoring
